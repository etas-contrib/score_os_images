# EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications: image from scratch

Builds a new `score-image` aarch64 disk image with KAS/Isar.
The standalone [recipe](meta-score/recipes-images/score-image/score-image_1.0.bb)
is derived from the toolkit's
[`fastdev_1.0.bb`](https://github.com/Elektrobit/eb_corbos_toolkit/blob/fe2cddbc01232e4b62accb9abab783c8ccf75ef7/layers/meta-ebclfsa/meta-ebclfsa-public/meta-ebclfsa-public-images/recipes-images/fastdev/fastdev_1.0.bb),
without `ebclfsa-comfwdlib-sim` or `ebclfsa-li-demo`.
It retains `ebclfsa-hi-cflinit` and its mandatory `ebclfsa-hi-demo` application
for booting with the shared QEMU configuration.
[kas.yml](kas.yml) selects it instead of `fastdev`.
Unlike [`//ebclfsa_aarch64_prebuild`](../ebclfsa_aarch64_prebuild),
it neither downloads nor boots the toolkit's prebuilt disk image. The toolkit
still supplies precompiled system packages, including the kernel; this is an
image build from packages, not a source rebuild of the entire OS.

```console
$ bazel build //ebclfsa_aarch64:image //ebclfsa_aarch64:kernel
```

The build takes a long time, so all image targets are tagged `manual` and are
only built when selected explicitly. The kernel and `.wic` disk image are written
to `bazel-bin/ebclfsa_aarch64/`.

| Target | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `:image` | The `.wic` disk image |
| `:kernel` | The kernel required to boot the image |
| `:qemu_config` | QEMU configuration shared with `//ebclfsa_aarch64_prebuild` |
| `:network_config_deb` | The `score-network-config` Debian package |

## Requirements

- An x86_64 Linux host with Docker, `dpkg-deb` (from `dpkg`), and permission to
  run privileged containers. The Docker daemon must see the Bazel output
  directory at the same absolute path as the build process (no remote daemon).
- Network access to GitHub, GHCR and the package repositories referenced by the
  toolkit, and substantial free disk space for the Isar build.

The build runs the toolkit's digest-pinned development container. It registers
its aarch64 binfmt interpreter if none is registered; this requires privileged
access and affects the host kernel's binfmt registry. KAS/Isar needs privileges
for chroots and mounts, so the action cannot run in a Bazel sandbox or on a
remote executor.

## Network configuration

The image uses the same network configuration as `//ebclfsa_aarch64_prebuild`
([`network`](config-overlay/etc/config/network)): static
address `169.254.158.190/16` on `eth0`, gateway `169.254.21.88`, and a multicast
route. The file is packaged as `score-network-config`, which [kas.yml](kas.yml)
selects through `EBCLFSA_FASTDEV_NETWORK_CONFIG` in place of the toolkit's
`ebclfsa-fastdev-network` package. It therefore matches the addresses in
[`qemu_config.json`](qemu_config.json).

## Root SSH login

Like `//ebclfsa_aarch64_prebuild:image`, the image permits passwordless root SSH login for
integration testing. It must never be used in production.

- The `score-itf-sshd-config` package installs
  [`99-integration-test.conf`](sshd-config/99-integration-test.conf) into
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d`.
- [`score-image_1.0.bb`](meta-score/recipes-images/score-image/score-image_1.0.bb)
  clears the root password at the end of the rootfs post-processing, after the
  toolkit has set its default password `linux`.

## /opt mount

A secondary disk image can be attached to the QEMU targets via the `--qemu-disk` option, in which case it is mounted on `/opt` inside the guest.
The image recipe adds `/dev/vdb` to `/etc/fstab` with `nofail`, so the image
also boots when no secondary disk is attached.

## Selecting packages

Edit `IMAGE_PACKAGES` in [BUILD](BUILD) to select the Debian packages installed in
the image. The [build script](build_image.sh) accepts zero or more Debian package
paths after its three fixed arguments:

```console
$ bash ebclfsa_aarch64/build_image.sh \
    /path/to/toolkit ebclfsa_aarch64/kas.yml \
    /existing/output/directory \
    /path/to/first.deb "/path/to/another package.deb"
```

Each package is copied into its own generated `dpkg-prebuilt` recipe in a
temporary workspace, and a generated KAS fragment adds all package names, read
from the Debian control metadata, to `IMAGE_INSTALL`. Duplicate package names are
rejected. Packages must be compatible with the arm64 image, and their
dependencies must be available from the configured repositories or supplied in
the same list.

## Tests

The ping, multicast and no-disk QEMU integration tests boot the image with
`:qemu_config`. The test is tagged `manual`, so
`bazel test --config=qemu-integration //tests/...` does not build this image:

```console
$ bazel test --config=qemu-integration //tests:ebclfsa_qemu_test //tests:ebclfsa_qemu_opt_mount_test
```

The [EBcLfSA workflow](../.github/workflows/ebclfsa.yml)
builds the image and runs these tests when files of this package, the shared
network or QEMU configuration, or the tests change. It can also be started manually.

## Release images and SDKs

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs when a GitHub
release is published, including prereleases. It checks out the release tag and
builds `score-image` and its matching SDK for QEMU aarch64 (`ebcl-qemuarm64`)
and Raspberry Pi 4B (`rpi4b`).

The same builds can be run locally:

```console
$ bazel build //ebclfsa_aarch64:release-ebcl-qemuarm64 //ebclfsa_aarch64:release-rpi4b
```

Outputs are written to `bazel-bin/ebclfsa_aarch64/release/<machine>/`.
For each machine, the workflow attaches these assets to the existing release,
following the upstream toolkit's archive layout:

- `score-image-trixie-ebclfsa-<machine>.tar.gz`: disk image, kernel, image
  SPDX metadata and the generated development SSH private key.
- `score-image-sdk-trixie-ebclfsa-<machine>.tar.gz`: cross-compilation SDK sysroot.
- `score-image-sdk-trixie-ebclfsa-<machine>.spdx.json`: SDK SPDX metadata.
- `score-image-trixie-ebclfsa-<machine>.sha256`: checksums of the three assets.

The Raspberry Pi build uses the toolkit's Raspberry Pi BSP, boot files and
fstab configuration; the additional `/opt` disk mount is QEMU-only. Both images
retain the S-CORE network configuration and passwordless root SSH login described
above and are **for integration testing, not production**.

Each image archive includes `score-image-trixie-ebclfsa-<machine>-ssh-target-key`,
whose public key is installed in root's `authorized_keys`. After extracting the
archive, connect using the key for that image build:

```console
$ chmod 600 score-image-trixie-ebclfsa-ebcl-qemuarm64-ssh-target-key
$ ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i score-image-trixie-ebclfsa-ebcl-qemuarm64-ssh-target-key root@169.254.158.190
```

For Raspberry Pi, use the `rpi4b` key instead and the device's reachable IP
address. Key-based login remains available if passwordless login is removed.
These keys are deliberately public development credentials: anyone downloading
the release can log in as root on a reachable image. Use only on isolated test
networks, never reuse the keys elsewhere, and replace the authorized key and
disable passwordless login before any non-test deployment. SSH server host
private keys are not included in the archives.

Both platform builds must succeed before any assets are published. Re-running a
successful workflow replaces assets with the same names. If releases are created
by another workflow using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, GitHub will not trigger this workflow;
use a GitHub App token or personal access token for that release creation instead.
